These are slides for a talk I gave at the Telluride Science Research Centre
when I attended the 2019 meeting on "Stochastic Approaches to Electronic
Structure Calculations".

Telluride is very high up...

Special trip: this was the first time I travelled entirely alone from my home
in the UK to the other side of the atlantic. I spent the entirety of my
birthday travelling. Woke up at 5am in Lancaster, went to bed after midnight in
Telluride.
