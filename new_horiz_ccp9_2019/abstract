The accurate determination of the excited state properties of atoms, molecules,
and solids is an outstanding goal of modern theoretical and computational
physics. In the past few decades, progress on this problem has been made in
many avenues; notably in those approaches based on density functional theory,
many-body perturbation theory (often in the "GW" approximation), and the
various quantum chemistry methods (coupled cluster, configuration interaction,
other "post-Hartree-Fock" methods). Here, we present the results of a recent
comprehensive study on the use of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for the
description of excited states in condensed matter systems. We will give some
examples on the treatment of atomic, molecular, and condensed matter systems,
and some insight into the hurdles facing future highly-accurate QMC studies of
excited states. Finally, we give an example of how QMC can be used to
extract the exciton binding energy of 2D phosphorene from first principles,
highlighting the specific issues that 2D systems present for first principles
calculations.
